## 2020 Wildfire Perimeters

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(geojsonsf)



fires <- geojson_sf("California_Fire_Perimeters_(1950%2B).geojson" )

recent_fires <- fires |>
  filter( YEAR_ == 2020 )

tmap_options( basemap.server = "USGS")
tmap_mode( "view" )
tm_shape( recent_fires ) +
  tm_polygons( id = "FIRE_NAME", fill = "firebrick")

```

## What do we plan to do with this data?
- We aim to predict current wildfire risk across Californiaâ€™s 58 counties using past fire data, including 2020 wildfire perimeters, alongside historical weather data (average monthly temperature and precipitation).
- This map displays wildfire perimeters in 2020 and its data is taken from the California National Resource Agency (CNRA).
- Understanding past fire-affected areas is crucial as these landscapes are more susceptible to extreme weather patterns, influencing present fire risks.
